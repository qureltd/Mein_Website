## Checkpoint: Start of Day — 2026-06-28

### Git / Branch Status

**Note:** This project has no local `.git` directory as of this checkpoint. The project is managed by
Bolt's internal version control. A GitHub remote has not been connected.

Intended branch target: `feature/mein-phases2-to-10-buildout`

**Required action before implementation begins (manual — cannot be done via code):**
1. Connect the Bolt project to a GitHub repository via the Bolt dashboard if not already done.
2. Create or switch to branch: `feature/mein-phases2-to-10-buildout`
3. After this file is created, commit it with message:
   `Add MEIN start-of-day checkpoint for phases 2 to 10`
4. Create the Git tag:
   `checkpoint-mein-start-20260628-phase2-postmark`
5. Push the branch and tag to remote.

### Completed Phases

#### Phase 0 — Emergency Security and Routing Cleanup (Completed 2026-06-28)

Changes made:
- `/admin` protected by `AdminRouteGuard` + Supabase Auth check against `admin_users` table
- `/admin/login` created (`AdminLoginPage.tsx`)
- `/consent/:token` placeholder route created (`ConsentPlaceholderPage.tsx`)
- `/wall` added as canonical route for StoriesPage; `/stories` now redirects to `/wall`
- Route aliases added: `/home` → `/`, `/start-here` → `/`, `/what-is-mein` → `/about`
- `AdminRouteGuard.tsx` created — checks session AND admin_users table email
- RLS fixed: anon cannot SELECT from submissions, consent_requests, or admin_users
- Stories: anon can only SELECT where `published_at IS NOT NULL`
- Public INSERT preserved on submissions for all public forms
- Nav and Footer updated to use `/wall` as canonical Wall link
- Build: clean (pre-existing chunk size warning only)

Files changed in Phase 0:
- `src/App.tsx`
- `src/components/Nav.tsx`
- `src/components/Footer.tsx`

#### Phase 1 — Foundation Database Tables and Storage Buckets (Completed 2026-06-28)

Changes made:
- 7 new tables created: `join_interests`, `contact_messages`, `shop_drops`, `shop_products`,
  `email_events`, `media_assets`, `audit_logs`
- Additive columns added to existing tables:
  - `submissions`: admin_notes, rejection_reason, reviewed_at, published_at, consent_scope, public_display_name

  - `consent_requests`: consent_type, consent_scope, signed_name, consent_text_version, withdrawn_at, admin_notes, responded_ip
  - `admin_users`: role (with CHECK constraint), full_name, last_login
- RLS applied to all new tables:
  - `join_interests`, `contact_messages`: anon INSERT only; authenticated full CRUD
  - `shop_drops`, `shop_products`: anon SELECT where visible=true only; authenticated full CRUD
  - `email_events`, `media_assets`: authenticated only
  - `audit_logs`: authenticated SELECT + INSERT; no UPDATE/DELETE (immutable)
- FK: `shop_drops.hero_product_id → shop_products.id` (SET NULL on delete)
- FK: `shop_products.drop_id → shop_drops.id` (SET NULL on delete)
- 4 storage buckets created:
  - `submission-media` (private, 50MB, images/video/pdf)

  - `wall-content` (public, 15MB, images)
  - `consent-documents` (private, 10MB, pdf/images)
- Storage RLS: private buckets admin-only; public buckets allow anon read
- `updated_at` triggers added to: stories, join_interests, contact_messages, shop_drops, shop_products
- Indexes added to all new tables
- Seed data for Drop 001 deferred to Phase 7
- Build: clean (pre-existing chunk size warning only)
- No public page behavior changed

### Today's Work Range: 2026-06-28

**Starting phase:** Phase 2 — Postmark email infrastructure
**End checkpoint target:** Phase 10 — Final QA / release readiness checkpoint

### Roadmap Status

| Phase | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Emergency security, RLS, admin protection, route cleanup | Completed |
| 1 | Foundation database tables + storage buckets | Completed |
| 2 | Postmark email infrastructure | Starting |
| 3 | Connect public forms to correct tables | Pending |
| 4 | Admin shell, auth, dashboard structure | Pending |
| 5 | Consent workflow and /consent/:token form | Pending |
| 6 | Submission review + Wall publishing workflow | Pending |
| 7 | Shop product manager + Shopify link-out setup | Pending |
| 8 | Contact messages + members/join interests admin sections | Pending |
| 9 | Hardening, roles, audit logs, exports, QA | Pending |
| 10 | Final QA, release readiness, cleanup, documentation, deployment readiness | Pending |

### Intended Work Today

- Phase 2: Supabase Edge Function for email sending via Postmark; email_events table logging;
  template plan; secret configuration
- Phase 3: Connect MakeYourMovePage, FutureMePage, ContactPage, SchoolsPage forms to correct
  Supabase tables (submissions, contact_messages, join_interests)
- Phase 4: AdminDashboard shell — tab structure, stats overview, navigation; submission inbox;
  role-aware layout
- Phase 5: Consent workflow — /consent/:token reads consent_requests by token (safe lookup);
  guardian approval/decline flow; consent_requests status update
- Phase 6: Submission review workflow — status transitions (received → under_review → approved →
  published); Wall publishing (creates stories row); admin_notes; rejection_reason
- Phase 7: Shop product manager — seed Drop 001 data; admin CRUD for shop_products/shop_drops;
  ShopPage migrated from hardcoded to database-driven
- Phase 8: Contact messages admin section; join interests admin section
- Phase 9: Role enforcement; audit_logs wiring; CSV export; hardening; QA
- Phase 10: Final QA pass; release readiness checklist; documentation update

### Safety Notes — Must Not Break

- `/admin` must remain protected. AdminRouteGuard must not be weakened.
- Phase 0 RLS policies must not be removed or weakened.
- Public forms (Make Your Move, Future Me, Contact, Schools) must continue to work.
- `/wall` must continue to show published stories only.
- Anonymous users must never be able to SELECT submissions, consent_requests, or admin_users.
- `shop_products` and `shop_drops` anon SELECT must remain limited to `visible = true`.
- Storage bucket privacy settings must not be changed (submission-media and consent-documents
  must remain private).
- `audit_logs` must remain INSERT-only (no UPDATE/DELETE policy).
- The `stories.published_at IS NOT NULL` anon filter must not be removed.
- No public page design or copy should be changed unless explicitly scoped in the phase.
- Build must pass after every phase.

## Phase Log

### Phase 2 — Postmark Email Infrastructure

Status: Completed
Started: 2026-06-28
Completed: 2026-06-28

Changes:
- Audited existing project: no prior email provider, no prior Edge Functions, no Postmark secret present
- Created Supabase Edge Function: `send-email` (deployed ACTIVE, verifyJWT: true)
  - File: `supabase/functions/send-email/index.ts`
  - Accepts POST with: email_type, recipient_email, recipient_name, template_alias (optional override),
    template_data (optional), related_table (optional), related_id (optional), dry_run (optional)
  - Validates: email_type (against 12-value allowlist), recipient_email format, template resolution
  - Uses SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (server-side only) to write to email_events table
  - Reads POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN from secrets only — never exposed to frontend
  - Reads POSTMARK_FROM_EMAIL (default: hello@mein.world) and POSTMARK_MESSAGE_STREAM from secrets
  - Dry run mode: logs email_events row, skips Postmark call, returns dry_run: true
  - Full send: inserts pending row → calls Postmark template API → updates to sent/failed
  - Stores postmark_message_id on success; stores error_message on failure
  - Returns only safe error messages to callers; internal errors logged via console.error only
  - Missing POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN: returns safe 500 and logs failed event
  - Unknown template alias (Postmark 422): surfaces safe template error to caller

Secrets required (to be added via Supabase dashboard or secrets manager):
  - POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN — required for live sends; function degrades safely without it
  - POSTMARK_FROM_EMAIL — optional, defaults to hello@mein.world
  - POSTMARK_MESSAGE_STREAM — optional, omitted from Postmark payload if not set
  - ADMIN_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL — reserved for Phase 4/5 use; not used in Phase 2

Email type → template alias map (templates must be created in Postmark dashboard):
  - consent_request          → mein-consent-request
  - consent_confirmation     → mein-consent-confirmation
  - consent_declined         → mein-consent-declined
  - submission_received      → mein-submission-received
  - submission_approved      → mein-submission-approved
  - submission_published     → mein-submission-published
  - contact_confirmation     → mein-contact-confirmation
  - admin_new_contact        → mein-admin-new-contact
  - admin_new_submission     → mein-admin-new-submission
  - join_confirmation        → mein-join-confirmation
  - drop_signup_confirmation → mein-drop-signup-confirmation
  - drop_launch_notification → mein-drop-launch-notification

Security/access:
  - verifyJWT: true — only authenticated callers (admin or trusted server) can invoke
  - Public forms do NOT call send-email directly in Phase 2
  - Arbitrary email dispatch is admin/server-only to prevent abuse

Test (curl dry_run example — requires valid JWT):
  curl -X POST https://bjimkxrangfaiwofrzkf.supabase.co/functions/v1/send-email \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-jwt>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "email_type": "submission_received",
      "recipient_email": "test@example.com",
      "recipient_name": "Test Person",
      "template_data": { "submission_type": "future_me" },
      "dry_run": true
    }'

Verification results:
  - send-email deployed ACTIVE in Supabase Edge Functions
  - email_events insert/update cycle tested and confirmed (insert pending → update sent with dry_run marker)
  - No POSTMARK_ string anywhere in frontend src/ code
  - email_events table accepts all fields the function writes
  - Build: clean (pre-existing chunk size warning only)
  - No public page or form behavior changed

Manual Postmark dashboard steps required before live sends:
  1. Create a Postmark account and server at postmarkapp.com
  2. Add sender domain/email (must match POSTMARK_FROM_EMAIL, e.g. hello@mein.world)
  3. Verify sender domain DNS records in Postmark
  4. Create each of the 12 template aliases listed above
  5. Set POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN secret in Supabase (dashboard → Settings → Edge Functions → Secrets)
  6. Optionally set POSTMARK_FROM_EMAIL and POSTMARK_MESSAGE_STREAM

### Hotfix: Admin Access (joel@meintoday.com cannot log in)

Date: 2026-06-28
Status: Resolved

Root cause:
Two compounding issues prevented admin login despite correct credentials:

1. Missing GRANT: The `authenticated` role had no explicit `GRANT SELECT ON admin_users`.
   PostgreSQL RLS policy alone is not sufficient — the table-level privilege must also exist.
   The shared Supabase instance did not automatically add this grant when admin_users was
   created via migration. The anon/authenticated schema ACL only showed USAGE (not SELECT).

2. Silent error swallowing: Both AdminLoginPage.tsx and AdminRouteGuard.tsx called
   `.maybeSingle()` on admin_users without checking the returned `error`. A permission
   denied error was treated identically to "no row found", showing "You do not have admin
   access" with no way to distinguish the real cause.

Changes made:

Migration: supabase/migrations/20260628_admin_users_grant_and_secure_rls.sql
  - GRANT SELECT ON admin_users TO authenticated (explicit, resolves the privilege gap)
  - DROP POLICY "select_admin_users" (removed USING (true) — was too permissive)
  - CREATE POLICY "select_own_admin_user" FOR SELECT TO authenticated
      USING (lower(email) = lower(auth.jwt() ->> 'email'))
    Tighter policy: authenticated users see only their own admin_users row
  - last_login UPDATE deferred to a later migration

src/pages/AdminLoginPage.tsx
  - admin_users query now destructures { data, error } (previously ignored error)
  - if adminError: logs to console.error, shows "Admin access check failed" to user
  - if !adminRecord and no error: shows "You do not have admin access"
  - error cases are now clearly distinguished

src/components/AdminRouteGuard.tsx
  - admin_users query now destructures { data, error }
  - if adminError: logs to console.error (does not expose detail to user)
  - route guard behavior unchanged: still redirects to /admin/login when not allowed

Security posture:
  - /admin is still protected by AdminRouteGuard
  - anon has no SELECT on admin_users (GRANT only covers authenticated)
  - each admin can only read their own row (tighter than before)
  - no admin email in frontend code
  - no RLS bypass
